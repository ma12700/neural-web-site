inputs : P - R - S - W - b - F
output : diagram - learning steps - test other inputs

question : 
	1- what is the number of targets
	2- what is the number of prototypes
	3- what is the number of elements in each prototype (R)
	4- are you want to add target?
	4- Is there intial weight? if yes get it
	5- Is the bias is required? if yes is there intial bias if yes get it
	6- are you will use (0|1) patterns or (-1|1) pattern for inputs
	



information : 
	1- perceptron is one layer only and may not get the solution example XOR gate draw it to understand
	2- hamming is two layer and has the standard way to get weight and bias in each layer
	3- hepp (be care when we want to use hepp or pseudoinverse to get the perceptron if we have bias)
	4- backpropagation let to tomorrow
